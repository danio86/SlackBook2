# SlackBook

SlackBook is a platform on which people can get in touch with each other. You can form groups/channels here and exchange and discuss any topic here. Texts or pictures can be posted for this. The channels can be public or private, so two people can also chat privately with each other.

__The Send us a message section__

  - This section will allow the user to send us (***coachfinder-company***) a message with feddback, questions, suggestions, and complaints.
  - to submit the message, the has to type in an e-mail address. 
  - If it were a real website, the only way the company could reply was like that. If the user wants to delete his message or e-mail address, the Clear Form button can be clicked.
  - After sending the message, the user will receive confirmation that the message has arrived and is being processed. Since Coachfinder does not have a real server, the ***Code-Institute*** server was used as an example. Since no nice answer appears here, a *Receive Answer button* has been added. Clicking on this button demonstrates how feedback will look like in the future. If the company ever exists, this button will be deleted.
  - The *Receive Answer button* leads to a **fourth web page (The Response Page)** that can only be reached here. 

  - Contact
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-contact.png" alt="Contact">


### The Response Page

  - The Response Page contains the same header and footer as the other web pages. Additionally, there is a response section under the header. Here is the message that the request has been received and is being processed.

  - Response

### The Login Page

  - This page will allow the user to log in to coachfinder. If the user has not yet registered, he can do so here. No user can log in without having registered. After klicking the sign up button oder the login butten, without beeing registered, the user comes to the signup page.

  - Login
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-login.png" alt="Login">


### The Sign Up Pages

  - There are two Sign Up pages with different headings. To the first one the user comes by clicking the Sign Up button, to the other page the user comes by trying to log in without being registered first. Other than that, both sides are the same. The user can register here. All fields are mandatory.
  - A few lines of javascript were used for the repeat-password field. The basic code for this is taken from the following website.
    - [Codepen](https://codepen.io/diegoleme/pen/qBpyvr)

  - Sign Up

### The Thank You Page

  - The Thank You (thx) page contains a landing image with a message inside. In it, the company Coachfinder thanks the user for registering it. In the future, the user will now receive an email in which he must click a confirmation link. This will lead him to a Coachfinder profile page. In the future he can then set up his profile. This page will be created in the future.

  - Thank You
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-thank-you.png" alt="Thank You">


### The Sport Category Page

  - The Sport Category page contains a landing image and a dropdown menu below. It is the same dropdown menu like the spors page. But only the sport category that the user clicked appears. Because there are far too many sports categories and only three pages to create, there is only one sample sports category page in this practice website. The other sports category pages will be created in the future.
  - The dropdown menu contains links to a specific sport page. Because there are far too many sports and only three pages to create, there is only one sample page in this practice website. The other specific sport pages will be created in the future.

  - Sport Category
  <img src="assets/images/screenshot-sport-category.png" alt="Sport Category">


### The Specific Sport Page 

  - The Specific Sport Page contains a list of coaches to choose. 
  - Here the user finds all the information he needs to decide on a trainer. This coach can then be contacted directly.
  - In the future you will find here a selection selected by location. The location is taken from the profile but can be changed here temporarily (travel situation). There will also be the option of contacting the coach via a chat function.

  - Specific Sport

### Unfixed Bugs

 - No Bugs are unfixed.
 - There were a few bugs, but they were fixed within a short time. 
  - For example, the Sports category page displayed well in Firefox and not in Google Chrome. The image formatting caused free white areas to appear on the page in Google Chrome. 
  - Another difficulty was the dropdown button (Sport) in the header menu. This had to be formatted separately, just like the other menu buttons.



## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - In menu on the left side, select pages
  - Scrool down to Branch and select main
  - push the Save button
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
